/*
INSERT INTO products (name, description, category, price_germany, price_norway, stock, active)
VALUES ('Test Product', 'Test description', 'fresh', 10.99, 129.00, 50, true)
RETURNING id, name;

/*
SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = 'PRODUCT_ID_HERE';
*/

-- TEST UPDATE: Update product stock (admin only)
-- Uncomment to test:
/*
UPDATE products
SET stock = 100, updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = 'PRODUCT_ID_HERE'
RETURNING id, name, stock;
*/

-- TEST DELETE: Delete a product (admin only - not recommended, use active = false instead)
-- Uncomment to test (use with caution):
/*
UPDATE products
SET active = false

-- ============================================
-- 10. FUNCTION TESTS
-- ============================================

-- Test: Calculate order total function
-- Replace ORDER_ID_HERE with actual order ID:
/*
SELECT calculate_order_total('ORDER_ID_HERE'::UUID) as calculated_total;
*/

-- Test: Verify order total matches sum of order items
SELECT 
  o.id as order_id,
  o.total_amount as order_total,
  COALESCE(SUM(oi.subtotal), 0) as calculated_total,
  CASE 
    WHEN o.total_amount = COALESCE(SUM(oi.subtotal), 0) THEN 'Match'
    ELSE 'Mismatch'

-- ============================================
-- 11. TRIGGER TESTS
-- ============================================

-- Test: Verify updated_at trigger works
-- Update a product and check updated_at changes:
/*
UPDATE products
SET stock = stock + 1
WHERE id = 'PRODUCT_ID_HERE'
RETURNING id, name, stock, updated_at;
*/

-- Test: Verify order total trigger works
-- Insert an order item and check order total updates:
/*
-- First, create a test order (replace USER_ID_HERE)
INSERT INTO orders (user_id, country, payment_method)
VALUES ('USER_ID_HERE', 'germany', 'cod')
RETURNING id;

-- Then insert order items (replace ORDER_ID_HERE and PRODUCT_ID_HERE)
INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity, price)
VALUES 
  ('ORDER_ID_HERE', 'PRODUCT_ID_HERE', 2, 10.99)
RETURNING id, subtotal;

-- Check if order total was updated
SELECT id, total_amount FROM orders WHERE id = 'ORDER_ID_HERE';
*/
